COHERENT to-do list.

Projects.
Floppy tape formatting.
Floppy tape volume management, e.g. something wrapped around gtar
for multiple archives on a single tape.
boot from b: (new BIOSES allow this)
stop locking out interrupts for so long in vt*kb.c when switching sessions.
drop from release:  kb,nkb,aha,ss
Udo's big crash bug - run qfind -b every 15 min or so, and start up
some big compiles.
Hal - drop -q from fsck
--
uutry - begin it with #!/bin/sh
fix fdisk command
Allow update to systems with /usr et al mounted elsewhere than /dev/root.
r09 /bin/sh fd leak, fix forthcoming from Nigel.
Move date grave in /etc/brc to past fsck because pipe is used, and/or
  modify date to read /dev/cmos directly, no pipe needed.
Fix mkfs so it doesn't screw up when handed an excessive inode spec in the
  proto file, or on the command line.
Fix badscan so it doesn't write a bogus number of inodes into a proto file,
  and so it doesn't complain about SCSI devices.
Use *volatile* prn in device drivers.
Udo:  Why does RAM need to be cleared on startup?
floppy drive bug
KBBOOT thing for fred
__kdmapdisp()
newusr appends ",fred" to user line for /etc/group, even for the first user
give getDmaMem alignment waste to the sysmem pool
foo.sh:  foo.sh crash
iomap bug
ftCmd signal bug
getDmaMem configuration stuff
io multiple segv bug
Add D_DMA, D_TAPE, D_NOBRKUP, D_MP to sys/conf.h for devflag support.
Nkb drivers - come up with a usable table, even before initial ioctl.
All kb drivers - get rid of ad hoc timing loops.
Nkb drivers: do scan set 1 before reboot.
Nigel: /bin/sh, /usr/bin/ksh
Save non-ndp libs before eradicating them.
Steve - libc.a, ndp, 4.2.6 (mktime.o)  _ut versions 8/4

/usr/bin/gzip, v 1.2.4, et al from Udo - 3/2

/etc/conf/cohmain/mkdev to ask about Cyrix upgrade cache enable.  Global
variable identifying CPU type, like the one that identifies ndp type
(partly for testing, so we can patch it to fake out the kernel).  Add
<sys/cyrix.h> - 3/2

Advanced printer configuration, slightly humanizes LPTEST etc. - 3/2

/etc/conf/vtnkb/src/vtnkb.c, /etc/conf/vtkb/src/vtkb.c - fixed the

with two video adapters. - 3/2

/etc/conf/bin/idbld to invoke /etc/conf/*/mkdev followed by
/etc/conf/bin/idmkcoh - 3/2

Write mkdev's for at, ss, aha - so customers can change configuration
after installation. - 3/2

Louis's provisional fix for df, to coh.386/sys5.c - 2/28

Nigel's curses bug fixes, merged by Louis.  This is provisional, because
Louis has more merging to do plus bringing Nigel, Udo, and himself into
sync with the latest version. /usr/lib/libcurses.a,
/usr/lib/ndp/libcurses.a - 2/28

Bogus  fd0: head=0 <Missing Address Mark>
when loading diskette 4 of 5 of 5-1/4" set.  Don't fully understand this
one, but the problem goes away when the first recal is replaced by a
seek to cyl 0.  (There is still another recal, which I did not change,
in case the controller is out of sync with cylinder id's.)  Changed
conf/fdc/src/fdc.c and conf/fd/src/fl386.c.

255 head fix for hai154x, recently received from Chris. Also increased
timeout in aha_hareset() to 1000 msec. 2/28

iomap fix and related changes, including addition of __kdenabio(),
__kddisabio(), __kdaddio(), and __kddelio() to the ddk.  Make i386/md.c
gcc clean.  Changes to i386/md.c, i386/k0.s, conf/vtnkb/src/vtnkb.c,
conf/nkb/src/nkb.c, conf/kb/src/kb.c, <sys/coherent.h>, <sys/vtkd.h> 2/28

/etc/install was still stupid about resuming failed partial installs.
Install is now a shell script, with recovery/retry, shell escapes, usw.
Also modem config stuff now merged into asy/mkdev where it belongs,
pending Steve's smart mux driver.
- changed /etc/install, /etc/install.u, /etc/conf/asy/mkdev on dalek 2/23

SEG_PWT (0x08) added to <sys/mmu.h>
- dalek updated 2/22

At end of upgrade, system hangs while running /conf/pwsetup.
- fix to /conf/pwsetup from Nigel written to dalek 2/22

Drop version printf from at driver.
- driver source changed 2/22

System does not stay in single user mode, regardless of exit status from
/etc/brc.  System does not allow users to stay logged in.  Both are due
to a bug in /etc/profile.
- dalek updated (/etc/profile, /etc/motd) 2/21
